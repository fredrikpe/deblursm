Modifications to SmartDeblur to handle gifs found on https://github.com/Y-Vladimir/SmartDeblur.

To run in linux download and run SmartDeblur located in the build folder.

The results folder contains results from an example run with the three frames used for parameter setting, and
the blurred and deblurred gifs.
